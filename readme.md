## PhotoSynthernet

Photosynthernet is an idea spawned by the shennanigans of irc chat and random domain thought processes. The Idea of 
PhotoSynthernet is to create a platform for the sharing of images centered around the color palettes and themes of said 
images. In the Meantime, this site also hosts some of my personal projects, because why not?
